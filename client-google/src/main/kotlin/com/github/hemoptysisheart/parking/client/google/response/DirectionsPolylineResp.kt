/**
 * [DirectionsPolyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-directions#DirectionsPolyline)
 *
 * [Polyline encoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) is a lossy
 * compression algorithm that allows you to store a series of coordinates as a single string. Point coordinates are
 * encoded using signed values. If you only have a few static points, you may also wish to use the interactive polyline
 * encoding utility.
 *
 * The encoding process converts a binary value into a series of character codes for ASCII characters using the
 * familiar base64 encoding scheme: to ensure proper display of these characters, encoded values are summed with 63
 * (the ASCII character '?') before converting them into ASCII. The algorithm also checks for additional character
 * codes for a given point by checking the least significant bit of each byte group; if this bit is set to 1, the
 * point is not yet fully formed and additional data must follow.
 *
 * Additionally, to conserve space, points only include the offset from the previous point (except of course for the
 * first point). All points are encoded in Base64 as signed integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values.
 * The encoding format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates representing latitude and longitude to a
 * reasonable precision. Given a maximum longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places (180.00000 to
 * -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed binary integer value.
